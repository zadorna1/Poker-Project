# Poker-Project
Project for parsing poker hands

This is the simple parser I have made in python for now. I'm fairly confident that it covers all the material we need to analyze. 
I have most of a data structure set up in C++, just a matter of putting the python regex to C++. If you see any glaring issues please just let me know!
